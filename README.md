# qq_progem_config
Repo which is going to be used to pull configuration from for my other project "qq_progem"

Files that have the word "_api" at the end stores properties related to the url of that microservice

Files that have the word "_mc" at the end stores property exclusive to that microservice eg Gateway_mc.yml will store values port number 1000 so when we run this microservice it will run on port 1000.
